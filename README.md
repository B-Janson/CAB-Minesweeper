## Client-Server Minesweeper

This project was developed in C to play a game of Minesweeper, with the server hosting the state 
of the game and the client querying what should be updated. The server handles up to 10
concurrent connections and maintains a leaderboard from uptime to when it is terminated.

## Login
To use the program, it requires a username and password upon starting up the client. This
information is located in Authentication.txt.
